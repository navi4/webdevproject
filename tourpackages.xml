        For a group or a romantica getaway, you watch the endangered white rhino in Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary and arrive in the afternoon in our Nature Lodges accommodation at Fort Murchison just outside Murchison Falls National Park. Have a cool drink, watch River Nile flowing by on her long journey to the Mediterranean Sea and listen to the sounds of the African night. Have a boat trip to the mighty Murchison Falls and watch numerous animals, especially lots of birds and very large Nile crocodiles. Enjoy the beautiful scenery of Uganda’s largest savannah park and see lots of Ugandan kobs, bush elephants and the endangered Rothschild’s giraffe. Maybe you will be lucky enough to have a glance of the elusive shoebill, a mixture of a stork and a pelican, when visiting the large papyrus swamps near the Nile delta.</description>
